Experiment the impact of representative sampling of model accuracy and training time

1. Instance segmentation (maskrcnnresnet50)
Sampling method - cluster_random 50% of dataset
- use the train and val dataset for representative sampling
- Keep test set separate for evaluation and comparison fwih model train on full dataset

other methods to experiment
- centroid
- entropy
- Near duplicate removal

-debug query_clust method and use it for experiment
